# bsky-filmove-tipy

This repo contains a code used in [Kino Šance](https://bsky.app/profile/kinosance.bsky.social), a Bluesky social network bot account which posts one random movie from [Česko-Slovenská filmová databáze](https://csfd.cz) per day.

The bot is written in Python and hosted on Azure Functions.

Posting to Bluesky is accomplished through [Bluesky Official API](https://docs.bsky.app/docs/tutorials/creating-a-post).
